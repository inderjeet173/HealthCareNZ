# CV Entry - NZ Health Dashboard Project

## Format 1: Comprehensive Experience Entry

**NZ Health Dashboard - Data Analytics & Visualization Project**
*Date: [Month-Year]* | Portfolio Project

---

### Project Overview
Developed an interactive web-based health analytics dashboard visualizing disease patterns across New Zealand regions using multi-dimensional data (2024-2025 datasets). Engineered complete data pipeline from processing to interactive web application.

### Key Responsibilities & Achievements

**Data Engineering & Processing**
- Processed and cleaned health datasets with 7 attributes (patient ID, age, gender, region, disease, cases, year) using Pandas
- Implemented age group binning logic to categorize patients into demographic buckets (0-18, 19-35, 36-50, 51+)
- Designed data models for efficient real-time filtering and aggregation

**Web Application Development**
- Built interactive dashboard using Dash framework with Flask backend
- Implemented responsive UI with multi-dimensional visualizations using Plotly
- Created 4 distinct chart types: bar charts (disease/region/age), donut chart (gender)
- Developed real-time KPI cards displaying total cases, top diseases, regional hotspots, and demographic insights

**Frontend & User Experience**
- Designed interactive filter system with multi-select dropdowns (year, region, disease)
- Engineered callback system enabling real-time chart updates based on user interactions
- Optimized responsive layout with CSS flexbox for professional appearance

**Analytics Features**
- Year-based trend analysis across 2024-2025
- Regional comparison capabilities with simultaneous filtering
- Demographic distribution analysis across age groups and gender
- Dynamic KPI calculation and rendering

### Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python 3.11+
- **Frontend**: Dash, Plotly, HTML/CSS
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Visualization**: Plotly Express

## Interview Talking Points

1. **Project Motivation**: "I built this project to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics capabilities, from raw data processing to interactive visualization. I chose healthcare data as it's relevant and impactful."

2. **Architecture Decisions**: "I selected Dash because it provides rapid development of interactive web apps without needing separate frontend/backend expertise. Plotly integrates seamlessly for high-quality visualizations."

3. **Data Pipeline**: "The dashboard processes New Zealand health data with 7 attributes, implements age group binning for demographic analysis, and aggregates cases by multiple dimensions for real-time calculations."

4. **Real-time Updates**: "I implemented a callback-driven architecture where user interactions with dropdowns trigger instant chart and KPI recalculations, providing seamless interactive experience."

5. **Scalability**: "The architecture is designed for future enhancements like export functionality, predictive analytics, and time-series trend analysis."

6. **Challenges Overcome**: "One challenge was optimizing filter performance with large datasets - I solved this through efficient Pandas groupby operations and strategic caching."
