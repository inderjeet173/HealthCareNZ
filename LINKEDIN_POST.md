# LinkedIn Post - NZ Health Dashboard

## Version 1: Professional & Technical

🏥 Excited to share my latest data analytics project: **NZ Health Dashboard**

I've built an interactive web-based dashboard that visualizes disease patterns and health trends across New Zealand regions (2024-2025).

**What it does:**
• Processes and analyzes health data with 7 key attributes (age, gender, region, disease type, case count, year)
• Provides real-time KPIs: total cases, top diseases, regional hotspots, and demographic insights
• Features multi-dimensional visualizations: disease breakdown, regional analysis, age group distribution, and gender insights
• Enables interactive filtering by year, region, and disease type for dynamic data exploration

**Tech Stack:**
Python | Dash | Plotly | Pandas | Flask

**Key Features:**
✓ Real-time dashboard with instant updates based on user filters
✓ 4 interactive visualization types across disease, region, age, and gender dimensions
✓ Multi-select filtering capabilities for comparative analysis
✓ Responsive KPI cards displaying key metrics

This project showcases how data visualization can drive actionable insights in healthcare analytics. Perfect opportunity to demonstrate full-stack data engineering from data processing to interactive UI.
